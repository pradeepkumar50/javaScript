        There are two main types of code editors: IDEs and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each type.

        1) Lightweight editors

        “Lightweight editors” are not as powerful as IDEs, but they’re fast, elegant and simple.

        Sublime Text (cross-platform, shareware).
        Notepad++ (Windows, free).
        Vim and Emacs are also cool if you know how to use them.

        2)  IDE

        The term IDE (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a “whole project.”

        Visual Studio Code (cross-platform, free).
        WebStorm (cross-platform, paid).
